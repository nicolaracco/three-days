# Specs

Specs translate a roadmap item (GDD §13) into a contract a reviewer can use to decide whether the implementation is done. They are the mechanism by which "scope creep" or "quality-bar drift" become explicit decisions instead of accidents.

## Authoring discipline

- Specs are written **just-in-time**, not all at once. Stay one or two specs ahead of implementation. The roadmap moves; specs written far in advance go stale.
- One spec per shippable feature. If the spec covers more than one feature, split it.
- A spec exists when work starts on its feature, not before.
- A spec stops being authoritative when its status is `Done`. After that, the code is the source of truth and the spec is a historical artifact.

## Workflow

1. The `spec-author` agent (`.claude/agents/spec-author.md`) drafts a spec from a GDD §13 day item.
2. The user approves the spec (status → `Approved`).
3. The `implementer` agent (`.claude/agents/implementer.md`) takes an approved spec and writes code, **only** what the spec describes.
4. The `quality-reviewer` agent verifies the diff against the spec's acceptance criteria and the GDD §12 quality bar.

## Numbering

Specs are numbered in the order they're authored, not in the order of the roadmap: `0001-…`, `0002-…`. The `Roadmap day` field in the spec frontmatter records which §13 day item it serves.
